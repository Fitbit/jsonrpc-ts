This package is a set of components which makes it easy to implement a
JSON-RPC 2.0 client or server (or both) over any reliable transport. It
is designed to be extremely customizable to fit nearly any use-case.
If the implementation of a component from this library doesn't suit your
needs, you can simply use your own implementation instead. Even the
way that request ids are generated can be customized!
